    <b>Raccoon</b> is a free and open source mobile-first client for Friendica and Mastodon.

    Friendica is an outstanding social plaftorm, featuring powerful characteristics which make
    it unique in the federated world:

    </li>
    <li>
        native support for ActivityPub <b>groups<b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>direct messages</b>;

        possibility to organize your contacts in <b>circles</b>;
    </li>

<p>
    The web interface is great to access all of these features but on a mobile device there are
    different constraints for usability and readability, so it comes in handy to have an app to
    use the most important functions of the platform.
