    <i>Raccoon for Friendica</i> is a free and open source mobile-first Friendica client.
</p>
<p>
    Friendica is a really outstanding social plaftorm, featuring powerful characteristics which make
    it unique in the federated world:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        rich text editing, long posts, support for titles and spoilers;
    </li>
    <li>
        native support for ActivityPub <b>groups<b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>direct messages</b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        a <b>media gallery</b> where you can manage photos and albums;
    </li>
    <li>
        the possibility to organize your contacts in <b>circles</b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        the ability to quote (cross-post) other people's posts;
    </li>
    <li>
        RSS feed import;
    </li>
    <li>
        an integrated <b>event calendar</b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        and, of course, much more (see the official documentation)…
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The web interface is great to access all of these features but on a mobile device there are
    different constraints for usability and readability, so it comes in handy to have an app to
    use the most important functions of the platform.
