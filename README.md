# RaccoonForFriendica

This is a client for the Friendica federated social platform powered by Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)
and Compose Multiplatform (CMP). The reference platform is currently Android.

The project is _heavily_ inspired by the **RaccoonForLemmy** app for Lemmy, which demonstrated
something like this can be achieved with this tech stack.
This is why it retains part of its name, making clear that the two projects are related and share a
lot of common heritage.

## Want to try it?

Here are some options to install the application on your device. The best way to install testing APKs
is Obtainium, please insert this repository's URL as a source and make sure to check the
"Include prerelease" option:

## Why was the project started?

Because raccoons are so adorable, aren't they? ü¶ùü¶ùü¶ù

Joking apart, one of the main goals was to experiment with Kotlin multiplatform (KMP) and Compose
Multiplatform (CMP). This project has a fair degree of complexity and allows to put under stress
the existing solutions and evaluate what they behave like with common tasks (image loading, HTML
rendering, file system and gallery access, networking, local database management, shared
preferences, navigation, access to resources like fonts/drawables/localization, etc.).

Secondly, the Android ecosystem for Friendica was a little lacking, especially with few native
apps (except [Dica](https://github.com/jasoncheng/dica),
whereas [Friendiqa](https://git.friendi.ca/lubuwest/Friendiqa) is a very _cute_ example of Qt on
Android, although not a traditional mobile app at all). I ‚ù§Ô∏è Kotlin, I ‚ù§Ô∏è Free and Open Source
Software and I ‚ù§Ô∏è native app development, so there was a niche that could be filled.

In the third place, we were wondering whether the adoption of a platform like Friendica could be
improved with a user-friendly and easy to use mobile app that abstracts away some of the
complications of the current web UI. This is why this app looks a lot like a plain Mastodon client (
and technically speaking a lot of it actually _is_ a Mastodon client, using the Mastodon APIs of
Friendica), adding on top of it some Friendica specific features such as groups and circles
management. With this respect, it takes a different approach compared to other existing solutions
like the very feature-complete [Relatica](https://gitlab.com/mysocialportal/relatica) app, in trying
to look familiar to users with some UI they are already accustomed to.

This project is all about experimenting and learning, so please be _patient_ if you find some bugs
or missing features.

#### Disclaimer

This is an experimental project and some technologies it is build upon are still in pre-production
stage, moreover this is a side-project developed by volunteers in their spare time, so use _at your
own risk_, please don't expect a full-fledged and fully functional app and be prepared to occasional
failures and yet-to-implement features.

Please be willing to contribute if you can, requests and reports will be evaluated depending on the
time available.
