# RaccoonForFriendica
---

This is a client for the Friendica federated social platform powered by Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)
and Compose Multiplatform (CMP). The reference platform is currently Android.

The project is heavily inspired by the RaccoonForLemmy app for Lemmy, which demonstrated something
like this can be achieved. This is why it retains part of its name, making clear that the two projects
are related and share a common heritage.

#### Disclaimer

This is an experimental project and some technologies it is build upon are still in pre-production
stage, moreover this is a side-project developed by volunteers in their spare time, so use _at your
own risk_, please don't expect a full-fledged and fully functional app and be prepared to occasional
failures and yet-to-implement features.

Please be willing to contribute if you can, instead of being ready to demand. Thank you.
